PETase main structures obtained from QM/MM calculations

The structures are representative, therefore the distances of the reaction coordinates could not be the exactly as described in the paper. If one want to obtain the exact transition states use the OPTTS of ORCA software.

The structures were obtained from the following coordinates:

Free energy surface (FES) at AM1/d-PhoT/MM potential for mechanism of reaction involving PETase. The Acylation is described by two steps: a) Step 1, where the formation of tetrahedral intermediate (TI1) is observed and b) Step 2, where the formation of MHET (INT2) is observed. Contour interval of 2 kcal/mol.

MHET Formation Mechanism PMF2D describing the Deacylation Step A) Step3 B) Step4 as described in Scheme 2. Contour interval of 2 kcal/mol.

Details of the protocol will be available after publication.
